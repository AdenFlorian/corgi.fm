BUGS
====
- [ ] when typing in chat, if someone leaves the input box loses focus
- [ ] filters getting stuck
- [ ] changing room thru selector doesn't completely pick up new user name if changed in previous room?
- [ ] when hooking up reverb and changing filter to 0 it can cause a loud sound which triggers the master volume safety
- [ ] when ableton is open, shamu wont recognize midi keyboard
- [ ] when 2 people join around same time, they spawn on top of each other
- [ ] 2019-03-03 When playing note on keyboard and change connection, note keeps playing on previous instrument
	- need to somehow stop those notes
	- maybe need a sourceId for each event/note?

## FIXED
- [√] piano roll lines on infinite sequencer are off by one
- [√] when using external midi keyboard, the octaves dont line up right
- [√] new options are getting wiped by options from localstorage
- [√] 2019-03-10 Note getting stuck when playing keyboard really fast with mouse
	- haven't been able to reproduce
- [√] 2019-03-03 Note getting stuck on when just sequencers are playing at normal speed
	- put all 4 sequencers into same synth, with default release
- [√] when a note is playing and you switch tabs, the note gets stuck as on
	- fixed in 735a86f03a9d07f1baf1d4801e7d649829f33e8b
- [√] stuck notes on 1 client and not others
	- mitigate:
		- maybe periodically check if a note is held down on client and send update to everyone if changes
	- how could this happen?
		- events getting sent or received out of order?
		- key up event not getting sent at all?
	- what's responsible for stopping notes from other users?
		- receive VIRTUAL_KEY_UP action
	- repro
		- 2 clients
- [√] stuck notes when refreshing and a song is playing
- [√] 2019-03-03 note getting stuck on when switching synth osc types
	- no scheduled voice for it in debug visual
		- maybe audio node is undefined when it shouldnt be?
		- then when it tries to stop it, its ignoring it because its undefined
		- how to debug this tho
		- not sure how to repro
		- i think its specific to switching to and from noise osc type
		- can get stuck on noise or other type
		- where are the spots in the code that this could happen
		- the voice is getting released, but .stop() isn't getting called on the source node
		- audioNode is never null, but the issue is still happening
			- meaning, there is both an osc and noise buffer at same time
				- but that should never happen
		- how am i still hearing sound if the gain was disconnected?
			- maybe it wasn't?
		- there is still a scheduledVoice, because i can change the osc type
			- how?
				- onEnded wasn't called?
				- onEnded wont be called if audioNode never stops
				- maybe its from switching osc type during release
				- [√] make sure audioNode is stopped when switching synth osc type between noise and other
				- should probably just clean up how the synth voice handles noise vs other types
