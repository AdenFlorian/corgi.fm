# Now
- [√] external midi notes should always highlight keys
	- [ ] but make it make more sense, like visualize the octave somehow
- [√] add cookies banner thing for GDPR
- [√] right click menu to add nodes
- [√] sequencers should only play if connected to a playing master clock, even if indirectly

# Soon
- [ ] increase room deletion timeout
	- [ ] and make it so it's actually based on room lifetime instead of a loop
- [ ] put sequencer timeline animation as separate setting in options
- [ ] play note when placed in grid sequencer

# Later
