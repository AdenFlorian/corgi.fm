# Now
- [ ] hook up note-scanner with everything
	- [√] change sequencer state to whole new stuff
	- [√] respect sequencer isPlaying
	- [√] get sampler to support scheduled notes
	- [√] prevent multiple oscillators/voices on same instrument from playing same note at same time, including releasing
	- [√] make option for displaying note scheduler visual debug thing
		- [√] make option
		- places to toggle:
			- [√] synth view tsx
			- [√] in the visual tsx file
	- [ ] get stuff working again
		- [√] keyboard
			- [√] computer keyboard
			- [√] mouse
				- this is a bit tricky
				- need logic in local middleware, but that logic is currently only for local user
			- [√] midi keyboard
			- [√] check performance
		- [√] make note-scanner use note length from event
		- [ ] handle conflicting note lengths scenarios
			- scenario A
				- steps
					- 2 sequencers going to same synth
					- 1 note in each, same note, same start, but different length
				- expected
					- only the shorter note should be played, every time (ableton way)
			- scenario B
				- 2 sequencers going to same synth
				- seq A [== ===  ]
				- seq B [==== == ]
				- exp   [== = =  ] (ableton)
				- act   varies
		- [ ] sequencer animations
		- [ ] master clock play button animation
		- [ ] rate knob on infinite sequencer
	- **Bugs**
		- [ ] 2019-03-03 Note getting stuck on when just sequencers are playing at normal speed
			- put all 4 sequencers into same synth, with default release

# Soon
- [ ] allow adding connections from a node with no connections on it already
	- [ ] split up ConnectionView
		- [ ] Connector component
		- [ ] ConnectionLine component
- [ ] fix old view
- [ ] add ability to add nodes
- [ ] new graph state
	- [√] move reducers for the different node types under the shamu graph reducer, but keep them separate
	- [ ] update positions calculations to update positions in new graph state
		- keeping positions state where it is for now, the important thing is the actual node types
	- [ ] change all the old multi things to use new graph state
		- [ ] change selectors to grab from new graph state

# Later
- [ ] look into using an algorithmic reverb
	- https://itnext.io/algorithmic-reverb-and-web-audio-api-e1ccec94621a
- [ ] tone.js (on hold, not needed so far)
	- [√] master volume
	- [ ] synth
	- [ ] sampler
	- [ ] sequencer data structures
