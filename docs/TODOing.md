# Now
- [ ] add low graphics setting
	- [ ] notify user to lower graphics if low FPS
- [ ] mute button next to audio output
- [√] remove read ahead knob
- [√] maybe unpress all key when app loses focus
- [ ] hook up note-scanner with everything
	- [√] change sequencer state to whole new stuff
	- [√] respect sequencer isPlaying
	- [√] get sampler to support scheduled notes
	- [√] prevent multiple oscillators/voices on same instrument from playing same note at same time, including releasing
	- [√] make option for displaying note scheduler visual debug thing
		- [√] make option
		- places to toggle:
			- [√] synth view tsx
			- [√] in the visual tsx file
	- [ ] get stuff working again
		- [√] keyboard
			- [√] computer keyboard
			- [√] mouse
				- this is a bit tricky
				- need logic in local middleware, but that logic is currently only for local user
			- [√] midi keyboard
			- [√] check performance
		- [√] make note-scanner use note length from event
		- [ ] stopping a specific sequencer should immediately cancel scheduled notes from that sequencer
		- [ ] handle conflicting note lengths scenarios
			- scenario A
				- steps
					- 2 sequencers going to same synth
					- 1 note in each, same note, same start, but different length
				- expected
					- only the shorter note should be played, every time (ableton way)
			- scenario B
				- 2 sequencers going to same synth
				- seq A [== ===  ]
				- seq B [==== == ]
				- exp   [== = =  ] (ableton)
				- act   varies
		- [ ] sequencer animations
			- css animation
				- cons
					- little control
					- hard to keep perfectly in sync
				- pros
					- simple?
					- little code
				- notes
					- who should render it?
						- the sequencer?
							- annoying to redo on all new sequencers
							- don't have to since it's absolutely positioned
						- something else?
			- javascript/canvas
				- haven't done this yet
			- javascript/svg
				- have done, but its sloppy
			- [...] ECS
				- could take a while to get started
				- [√] remove all but one RAF loop
		- [ ] master clock play button animation
		- [√] infinite seq loop length
		- [x] rate knob on infinite sequencer
			- removed for now, not sure how to implement
		- [√] release all notes on stop
		- [√] stopping song shouldn't release notes being played by user
		- what does ableton do when you stop and there is a note with a really long release
			- it just keeps on releasing, even when you hit play again
			- but you can adjust release of note that are already releasing, in serum at least
		- [√] get noise osc on synth working with schedules
		- [√] make instrument params affect currently playing notes
			- [√] pan
			- [√] filter
			- [x] attack
				- chrome bug preventing impl
				- how?
				- cancelAndHold?
				- how to know when to adjust?
				- [ ] applyEnvelope function
			- [x] release
				- chrome bug preventing impl
			- [√] detune
			- [√] osc type
				- [√] normal
				- [√] noise
	- [√] animate active connections in the direction that data is flowing

# Soon
- [ ] make an ECS system for real time stuff
	- real time loop that reads redux state, or some other state, and renders stuff to canvases and what not
	- have a component for rendering to a canvas, one for DOM, text, audio even, etc.
- [ ] play note when placed in grid sequencer
- [ ] don't change current notes on keyboard when changing octave (at least not by default; something to put in options?)
	- not sure if possible/easy to make this an option
- [ ] allow adding connections from a node with no connections on it already
	- [ ] split up ConnectionView
		- [ ] Connector component
		- [ ] ConnectionLine component
- [ ] fix old view
- [ ] add ability to add nodes
- [ ] new graph state
	- [√] move reducers for the different node types under the shamu graph reducer, but keep them separate
	- [ ] update positions calculations to update positions in new graph state
		- keeping positions state where it is for now, the important thing is the actual node types
	- [ ] change all the old multi things to use new graph state
		- [ ] change selectors to grab from new graph state

# Later
- [ ] look into using an algorithmic reverb
