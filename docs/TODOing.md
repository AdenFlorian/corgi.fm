# Now
- [ ] hook up note-scanner with everything
	- [√] change sequencer state to whole new stuff
	- [√] respect sequencer isPlaying
	- [√] get sampler to support scheduled notes
	- [ ] get stuff working again
		- [...] keyboard
			- i want lowest latency possible for live keyboard playing
			- i also want the keyboard notes to union with the sequencers or other keyboards
				- this is hard, because the user playing the keyboard needs to be instant
					but the other sequencers are scheduling notes
			- first step?
				- if notes aren't getting combined some how, then things can get loud
				- not having super low latency is a deal breaker, so lets start there
			- where does the user input start from?
				- mouse
				- keyboard
					- input-events.ts
					- LOCAL_MIDI_KEY_PRESS
					- listen for action dispatch?
						- if we do, we need to listen for it in middleware
					- what are we even going to do with the key press?
						- directly schedule notes to the connected instruments?
					- what info do we need?
						- what key was pressed
						- virtual keyboard state (octave)
						- access to instruments
							- instrument-manager
							- could pass a ref to a middleware creator
							- or use getAllInstruments?
						- connections state (or a selector)
					- **do in local-middleware**
					- why am i not storing instrument refs in store?
					- [ ] PROBLEM
						- the way i schedule releases wont work with keyboard?
							- does it even work with multiple sequencers going to same instrument?
					- [ ] OCTAVE PROBLEM
						- switching octave while holding note
						- how did old system do it?
							- it releases old note and starts new one with newly triggered envelope
					- why not just use old system for keyboards only?
						- [ ] this works, but still has issue of playing two oscillators at same freq
		- [ ] sequencer animations
		- [ ] master clock play button animation
		- [ ] rate knob on infinite sequencer

# Soon
- [ ] allow adding connections from a node with no connections on it already
	- [ ] split up ConnectionView
		- [ ] Connector component
		- [ ] ConnectionLine component
- [ ] fix old view
- [ ] add ability to add nodes
- [ ] new graph state
	- [√] move reducers for the different node types under the shamu graph reducer, but keep them separate
	- [ ] update positions calculations to update positions in new graph state
		- keeping positions state where it is for now, the important thing is the actual node types
	- [ ] change all the old multi things to use new graph state
		- [ ] change selectors to grab from new graph state

# Later
- [ ] look into using an algorithmic reverb
	- https://itnext.io/algorithmic-reverb-and-web-audio-api-e1ccec94621a
- [ ] tone.js
	- [√] master volume
	- [ ] synth
	- [ ] sampler
	- [ ] sequencer data structures
